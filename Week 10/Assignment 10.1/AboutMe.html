     <p>
         As far as education goes I went to high school and got my diploma.
         After obtaining my diploma I worked a few various customer service and sales jobs.
         But for the past 4 years now I have been a radio operator in the USMC but I have
         decided to make a pivot into the software development industry.

    <p>
        I have many different hobbies but one of my favorite hobbies is collecting records. 
        I have over 100 records and counting and have a hi-fi record player, a receiver and some analog
        speakers I have wired into my receiver for listening to my records.
        Here is a link to my Discogs to show all of the records I currently have!
