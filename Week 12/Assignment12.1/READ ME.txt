1.Create an empty template mvc project. Add Product class as a model class with following fields:
a. Product Id
b. Product Name
Product Description
Product price
Product image
Add a IproductRepository with basic CRUD methods and write a class ProductRepository to implement these methods. (we will write logic afterwards)

Register this service in Configure services method

Add a ProductController to have action method “DisplayAll” which will return “AllProductsView”. This view will display all the products from repository.
Provide a link to click on each product and see the details of individual product like photo, description and price.

2.Implement CRUD by using repository pattern for product website.

3. Modify existing products website application to now work with databases.
4. Create a separate layout for 1 or 2 views to display different layout than other. You may decide which views from product website

5. Explore different bootstrap elements and check whether you could modify the product website with different bootstrap.
